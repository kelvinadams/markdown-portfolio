After seven years as a **mechanical engineer** 🤓 I am currently on a sabbatical to refocus my career path on roles that better align with my strengths. In conjunction with my engineering background, I have found that I thrive when I am designing **purposeful systems**, providing **technical leadership**, and being a **bridge for communication** both within and outside an organization. I thrive off the *deep-dive* into complex information and then *synthesizing* that into a clear, concise system or tool that can help solve problems for others. I enjoy digging into big-picture strategy, analyzing data to inform good decision-making, and designing tools/systems with the end-user in the forefront. I am also currently learning **Python** in order to further develop my systems-oriented skillset and as a tool for **data analytics**! 👍 📊
